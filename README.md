# Tcl (Task Class Library)
This is a class library project providing task features to application on dot net platform.<br>
This project started as a hobby, teach myself C#, not to mention very open source.<br>
Actually I'm not good at .net programming, neighter english.<br>
Have been living int embedded world about 20 years with data sheet, peripheral, interrupt, etc,<br>
it's time to turn around and find a way to hand over something to my fellow.<br>
Meanwhile what should I do...<br>
Technology is changed every each moment, but I don't know what is ChatGPT etc...<br>
They say oldies but goodies, so I'd like to update this projest with an orthodox iterative style, i.e.,<br>
requirement analysis, software design, implementation, [validation], reprospective.<br>
It might be better to set sprint and go for it, but my manager would not welcome.<br>
Probably doing it alone? I'd like to keep it simple as possible as I can, believe in occam's razor.<br>
